# Oyster_Challenge_home

(A simulation of) Transport for London's successful bicycle rental scheme.

(The brief)  
Transport for London the body responsible for delivery of a new bike system, come to you with a plan: a network of docking stations and bikes that anyone can use. They want you to build a program that will emulate all the docking stations, bikes, and infrastructure (repair staff, and so on) required to make their dream a reality.
